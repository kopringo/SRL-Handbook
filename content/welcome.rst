Welcome

This document is the guide for users of our *Online Judge* based services including:

 - `Sphere Engine <http://www.sphere-engine.com?utm_source=handbook>`_
 - `Sphere Contest <http://www.sphere-contest.com?utm_source=handbook>`_
      
First of all **it is not** comprehensive and exhaustive manual for vast area of technical issues of mentioned services. 
We focus on the essence of functionality namely the idea of processing source codes submitted into the system. 
As the user of one of our products you will be the creator of new programming problems. 

Let us introduce the convention 
of naming - the person who creates the problem is *the problem setter* or *the author* and the person who use the 
service and solves the problem is just *the user*. All presented information are independent of the type of 
our service thus we just call it *service*. Also note that the services are rather oriented to deal with console 
applications with standard input/output communication. The next section is a *dictionary* where we introduce simple definitions.
